# 1. AC-3 algorithm 
1. The famous ac-3 algorithm for arc consistency. 
2. I used this algorithm to make the domain of natural numbers 0-9 arch consistent with the  constraint x = y*y and variable x, y. 
3. After making x arc consistent with respect to y, the domain of x gets reduced to 0-3 from 0-9.
